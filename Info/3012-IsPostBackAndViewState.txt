IsPostBack and ViewState
=================================

Properites of controls changed during page-execution are added into the "ViewState".
Ex:

1. Add DropDownList1  + Button1
2. Page_Code:

   DropDownList1.Items.Add("Mehsana");
   DropDownList1.Items.Add("Surat");

3. Now run this page and see what happen? Cities are added cumulativey    into "DropDownList" due ViewState. [And we cannot disabled the    ViewState].




To address this issue, ASP.NET Page.IsPostBack boolean property returns "false" on first request and returns "true" on subsequent requests.

You can change control properties on first request only:


   if (IsPostBack==false) // !IsPostBack
        {
            DropDownList1.Items.Add("Mehsana");
            DropDownList1.Items.Add("Surat");
        }

NOTE: Whenever you want to assign data to control via properties, always wrap code in IsPostBack block especially in Page_Init/Load events. (DropDown,List,GridView,DataList,ListView and so on).
