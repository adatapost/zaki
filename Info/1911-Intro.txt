What do you meant by the term "Object"?

 
  It is the partitioned area of memory.

  Or

  Chunks of allocated bytes.


  Or

  Groups of bytes which are allocated by either OS or
  programming platform.

 
 Consider the following example:

   int no = 40;
    ^  ^
    |  |----- variable that is an alias of an object

   class 
 or datatype
 
  The OS/Platform allocate "four" bytes because of "int" type and these four bytes group is called an object whose address or reference is assigned to "no" variable.   


Class or Datatype
==================

 Class or Type or Datatype is a logical entity which includes data definition and function definitions (actions).

 A class is also called the template (structure) of an object.



What do you meant by "Object Oriented Paradigm"?
------------------------------------------------

 Its a program design technique. The OOP offers number of guidelines through which a developer can design/write his/her programs.

Following are major concepts introduced with OOP:

  1. Resuability of code
  2. Control the accessibility of code (Hide or show the code).
  3. Protect the "objects" by creating actions (or methods)      (Encapsulation)
  4. Real world polymorphism 
  5. Template Programming an so on.


Why we use "class" keyword in Java/C#/C++ languages?

We can create new datatype using "class" keyword.

Note: There are other keywords in diff languages through which you can design new datatypes.

In .net framework, we've approx 3000 TYPES (datatypes) designed using "class", "interface", "struct", "enum" and "delegate" keywords.
