WebForm and page parsing & compilation
===================================================================

ASP.NET WebForm web application is made up of number of special purpose programs called "WebForm" whose extension is ".aspx". The WebForm is a sub-class of System.Web.UI.Page class. When you create .aspx file, the application server implicitly parse that .aspx file and transform it to .cs or .vb class.

 Then the aspnet_compiler.exe tool (located at framework home directory) will compile .cs/.vb code into .dll each time when the content of .aspx is updated.

             |                         V

What will be the default compiler of .aspx page?
---------------------------
Its VB.NET (vbc.exe)

How to change VB lang to C#?
-------------------------------
Use <%@page language="C#"%> directive at the begining of .aspx page.

In VS, you can add .aspx page using one of the two templates:

   1. Single aspx page - code inline page model
   2. Two page - Code behind page model

In single page model, Html/Css/JavaScript and C# code will be stored into same page. There is no clean seperation of client and server code in code-inline model.

Code behind model has .aspx to present the markup and .aspx.cs or .aspx.vb for code. Code will be stored into seperate partial class.

What is the purpose of "directives"? (<%@ Page ....%>)
---------------------------------
 
 Directives are instructions to the "Parser/Compiler" to specify the page specific information before compilation starts.

 e.g sample.aspx
 ----------------
 <%@ Page Language="C#" %>
 <%@ Import Namespace = "System.Text" %>
 <%
   StringBuilder sb=new StringBuilder();
   sb.Append("One");
   sb.Append("Two");
   Response.Write(sb.ToString());
 %>
 

What is the purpose of "AutoEventWireUp"?
--------------------------------------------

Events are delegate and they need exact singnature of function/method. The "true" value to AutoEventWriteUp describes that no need to write down whole/exact syntax for page events -- page_load, page_init, page_preinit, page_prerender, page_unload and so on.


 
PS: Default value of AutoEventWireUp is "true".

To write events in inline-code, use

   <script runat="server">
        public void page_load() {} 
       ......
    </script>

to define methods and event handlers and use scriptlet <%..%> and 
<%=expr%> code tags to put executable statement.

<%
  //local variables and executable statements

  int no = 10;
  for(int i=1;i<=no;i++)
   {
     Response.Write("<br/>" + i);
    }
%>

<p>Value of no <%=no%>


<%=no%> is equivalent to 

<%
 Response.Write(no);
%>
